Short term, we still have to work with what exists.\n\nHere is my straight talk: You don't leverage probabilistic models by trusting outputs. You leverage them by trusting processes.\n\nThese systems are idea accelerators, not answer oracles. Great at generating plausible candidates. Terrible at guarantees.\n\nSo the winning move is simple:\n\nEnforce correctness downstream. Never hope for it upstream.\n\n5 principles that actually work:\n\n1. Trust processes, not outputs\n\nYou don't review every output line by line. You design constraints that make wrong answers expensive for the model and cheap for you to catch. Ask for reasoning, not conclusions. Force assumptions into the open. Request multiple independent perspectives. Agreement across samples is not truth, but it is a useful signal. This is triangulation.\n\n2. Use AI where variance is an asset\n\nProbabilistic systems shine when you want many candidate ideas, broad coverage of a search space, or an escape from local minima in thinking. They fail when one correct answer matters, when stakes are asymmetric, or when errors compound silently. Use them for ideation, drafting, exploration, refactoring, and test generation. Never in final authority roles. Think junior analyst who never sleeps and sometimes confidently lies.\n\n3. Externalize truth\n\nThe model should never be the final source of truth. Ever. Anchor outputs to formal systems like math, code, and type checkers. Ground them in databases, APIs, and real-world signals. Insert human judgment at decision choke points. In systems language, AI operates inside a control loop, not as the loop.\n\n4. Treat probability as a dial\n\nRandomness is not a bug. It is a control surface. Sampling temperature, prompting structure, and redundancy let you tune behavior intentionally. Low variance for consistency. High variance for discovery. Multiple samples for uncertainty estimation. This is operational discipline, not magic.\n\n5. Measure reliability empirically, not philosophically\n\nStop arguing about whether AI is intelligent. Start tracking where it fails. Measure error rates by task type. Identify failure modes. Watch for drift over time. Once you know where it breaks, you fence those areas off. This is how aviation, finance, and medicine work. No romance. Just guardrails.\n\nBottom line: Probabilistic models are not minds. They are leverage.\n\nLeverage doesn't need wisdom. It needs constraints, verification, and discipline.\n\nThat playbook is ancient. Still undefeated."

Instead of proving the math, we launch it. Instead of fixing bugs, we add altitude. This is escapism with a budget.\n\nAlso, let us be honest. The real reason is not science. It is vibes. Space sounds premium. Space looks good on a banner. \"To boldly go where no server has gone before\" is marketing poetry for \"we skipped the hard part.\"\n\nSort the tech here first.

She fed the model endless data about weather, time, and road patterns, hoping it would forecast exactly when traffic would snarl up. The results were a mess. The system was guessing far too much. Every day brought new variables it couldn't see coming.\n\nFrustrated, she changed her approach. Instead of trying to predict the future, she made the AI re-experience the past. She fed it years of traffic data and asked it not to predict but to reconstruct what had already happened. The model began to understand recurring causes: how sudden rain or a cricket match could ripple through the city's arteries. It wasn't fortune-telling anymore; it was pattern-recognition powered by memory.\n\nThat's when she noticed something else. The more connections the model made, the better it got. Each new data point acted like a Velcro hook, catching onto others and forming a tighter web of meaning. The AI wasn't storing isolated facts but building relationships between them. A traffic jam near the stadium linked to fan behaviour, which linked to weather forecasts, which linked to public transport usage. The richer the network, the smarter it became.\n\nHumans learn the same way. We are masters at reconstructing our past and attaching emotions, stories, and sensations to what we remember. These \"hooks\" make memories stick. We do not survive by predicting the future but by retelling the past until its lessons become instinct.\n\nAI, in its own way, mirrors that process. It learns not by seeing ahead but by looking back: replaying, connecting, and refining. Intelligence, whether human or artificial, grows from reflection, not prediction. What we remember, and how many threads we weave around it, decides how clearly we see the road ahead.\n\nP.S.

The details of that work will remain confidential, but what matters more is something timeless: adaptability.\n\nThat phase pushed me into the depths of systems thinking and engineering management. Today, as we navigate a world increasingly shaped by AI, the same core muscle matters even more: learn fast, think across disciplines, and move with clarity.

None of this happened by accident. It was a conscious choice to keep walking into complexity and unknowns. That's what gives me leverage today.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned, it's this: staying relevant isn't about chasing trends. It's about staying radically teachable.\n\nLet the world change.

But that's not what the data bysays. Here is a way to look at it:\n\n🔍 Signal vs. Noise:\n\n• 𝑆(𝑇) = useful signal extracted after T tokens\n• 𝑁(𝑇) = noise (distractions, hallucinations, spurious patterns)\n\nThen, net accuracy = 𝑨(𝑻) = 𝑺(𝑻) − 𝑵(𝑻)\n\nAnd the kicker: 𝑑𝑁⁄𝑑𝑇 > 𝑑𝑆⁄𝑑𝑇 when 𝑇 > 𝑇𝑐\n\nAfter a certain point, every extra token adds more confusion than clarity.\n\n✅️ But the real question is\n?\n\nBecause signal is\n: there's only so much truth in a prompt. Signal lives on a low-dimensional manifold.\n\nBut noise is\n: irrelevant patterns multiply as the model searches harder. Noise lives in a high-dimensional soup.\n\n👩‍💻 Real-World Example:\n\nA model is asked, \"You have an apple and an orange. How many fruits do you have?\"\n\nWith 10 tokens: it answers 2.\n\nWith 1000 tokens: it probably starts mapping and knitting the following: Is this a metaphor? Is the orange symbolic? What does \"have\" mean? Is there a quantum aspect to this?\n\nIt ends up saying, \"1.61 fruits, depending on interpretation.\"\n\nAs humans, we also tend to occassionally face similar situations where overthinking contaminates our own evidence. You give a riddle. Some solve it in 5 seconds.\n\nOthers overthink: \"What if it's a trick?\"\n\nSame with models. Given more room to (burn tokens) compute, they simulate more worlds, not more truth. Without a strong grounding prior or external feedback, they drift.\n\nThis is the epistemic entropy problem. More computation increases the entropy of the \"belief space\", not its sharpness. Because relevant truth is\n, but the number of plausible falsehoods is\n... and the AI has no instinct to stop.\n\nP.S. The graph has a typographical error that you may not have noticed. The label should be 'Noise N(T)'. However, we can ignore it as this is a minor error. You can now congratulate me for being human! 🤷‍♂️"

Short term, we still have to work with what exists.\n\nHere is my straight talk: You don't leverage probabilistic models by trusting outputs. You leverage them by trusting processes.\n\nThese systems are idea accelerators, not answer oracles. Great at generating plausible candidates. Terrible at guarantees.\n\nSo the winning move is simple:\n\nEnforce correctness downstream. Never hope for it upstream.\n\n5 principles that actually work:\n\n1. Trust processes, not outputs\n\nYou don't review every output line by line. You design constraints that make wrong answers expensive for the model and cheap for you to catch. Ask for reasoning, not conclusions. Force assumptions into the open. Request multiple independent perspectives. Agreement across samples is not truth, but it is a useful signal. This is triangulation.\n\n2. Use AI where variance is an asset\n\nProbabilistic systems shine when you want many candidate ideas, broad coverage of a search space, or an escape from local minima in thinking. They fail when one correct answer matters, when stakes are asymmetric, or when errors compound silently. Use them for ideation, drafting, exploration, refactoring, and test generation. Never in final authority roles. Think junior analyst who never sleeps and sometimes confidently lies.\n\n3. Externalize truth\n\nThe model should never be the final source of truth. Ever. Anchor outputs to formal systems like math, code, and type checkers. Ground them in databases, APIs, and real-world signals. Insert human judgment at decision choke points. In systems language, AI operates inside a control loop, not as the loop.\n\n4. Treat probability as a dial\n\nRandomness is not a bug. It is a control surface. Sampling temperature, prompting structure, and redundancy let you tune behavior intentionally. Low variance for consistency. High variance for discovery. Multiple samples for uncertainty estimation. This is operational discipline, not magic.\n\n5. Measure reliability empirically, not philosophically\n\nStop arguing about whether AI is intelligent. Start tracking where it fails. Measure error rates by task type. Identify failure modes. Watch for drift over time. Once you know where it breaks, you fence those areas off. This is how aviation, finance, and medicine work. No romance. Just guardrails.\n\nBottom line: Probabilistic models are not minds. They are leverage.\n\nLeverage doesn't need wisdom. It needs constraints, verification, and discipline.\n\nThat playbook is ancient. Still undefeated."

She fed the model endless data about weather, time, and road patterns, hoping it would forecast exactly when traffic would snarl up. The results were a mess. The system was guessing far too much. Every day brought new variables it couldn't see coming.\n\nFrustrated, she changed her approach. Instead of trying to predict the future, she made the AI re-experience the past. She fed it years of traffic data and asked it not to predict but to reconstruct what had already happened. The model began to understand recurring causes: how sudden rain or a cricket match could ripple through the city's arteries. It wasn't fortune-telling anymore; it was pattern-recognition powered by memory.\n\nThat's when she noticed something else. The more connections the model made, the better it got. Each new data point acted like a Velcro hook, catching onto others and forming a tighter web of meaning. The AI wasn't storing isolated facts but building relationships between them. A traffic jam near the stadium linked to fan behaviour, which linked to weather forecasts, which linked to public transport usage. The richer the network, the smarter it became.\n\nHumans learn the same way. We are masters at reconstructing our past and attaching emotions, stories, and sensations to what we remember. These \"hooks\" make memories stick. We do not survive by predicting the future but by retelling the past until its lessons become instinct.\n\nAI, in its own way, mirrors that process. It learns not by seeing ahead but by looking back: replaying, connecting, and refining. Intelligence, whether human or artificial, grows from reflection, not prediction.

Quietly, steadily, strategically... they've become the new enterprise darling.\n\nfinally showed up to the party, now sitting at a respectable 20%.\n\n? Still hanging on, but barely, slipping down to 9% despite some great open models. Maybe good code isn't enough without good strategy.\n\nNow zoom in on the coding market:\nleads again with 42%. That is wild. This used to be's turf. But devs are shifting camps. Fast.\n\nStay alert. The next plot twist is already loading... because LLMs have hit a 🧱 wall.\n\nSource:"

    "text": "God, the Formless and the Formed: A Mathematical Lens\n\nOur scriptures say:\n\n\"God is formless (Nirguna Brahman) as well as with form (Saguna Brahman).\nThose who say He is only with form limit Him who is limitless. Those who say He has no form limit Him just the same.\"\n\nLet's approach this through the lens of mathematical set theory, specifically, the null set.\n\nThe Sacred ∅ (Null Set):\n\nThe null set is not zero. It is the set that contains nothing, yet from it, everything arises. It is pure potential, unbounded by form, unshaped by time.\n\nLet's start with the premise that God = ∅.\nFormless, silent, empty, yet foundational.\nThat which contains nothing, yet from which all is built.\n\nFrom formless to form - In set theory:\n\n0 = ∅\n1 = {∅}\n2 = {∅, {∅}}\n3 = {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}\n… and so on.\n\nFrom ∅, an infinite hierarchy of form emerges. All of number, structure, and meaning... born from emptiness.\n\nSo:\nNirguna Brahman (formless divinity) = ∅\nSaguna Brahman (divinity with form) = F(∅)\n\n'F' here stands for Functor. All constructions arising from ∅.\n\nThe Paradox of Exclusivity:\n\nDenying either side limits the Infinite.\n\n• Say \"God is only with form\"? - You deny His foundation.\n• Say \"God is only formless\"? - You erase His attributes.\n\nEither view, taken in isolation, fragments the whole.\n\nFormal Expression\nLet: G = ∅ ∪ F(∅)\nThen:\nG ≠ ∅ (God is not only formless)\nG ≠ F(∅) (God is not only manifested)\n\nG is the unity of both.\n\nTo restrict G to either ∅ or F(∅) alone is to misrepresent the totality. Contradiction results. QED.\n\nGödel Weighs In:\n\nGödel's Incompleteness Theorems remind us: No system can fully contain or prove all truths about itself, especially if it is infinite.\n\nLikewise, no concept, doctrine, or theology can fully contain the Infinite. To define God solely within a single mode (form or formlessness) is an act of limitation.\n\nSo Next Time...\nWhen someone says \"God is only this\" or \"God is only that,\" smile compassionately and say:\n\nHe is both the ∅ and everything that flows from it. The unmanifest Source and His infinite manifestations. Formless, yet forever expressing.\n\nBecause: ∅ contains multitudes.\n\n🕉️ Where Vedas Meet Set Theory\n💡 Advaita Meets Mathematics\n🧠 The Infinite Meets Formal Logic"

A project I was working on had made its way to the top, and this note reminded me that depth, clarity, and original thinking still open real doors. The details of that work will remain confidential, but what matters more is something timeless: adaptability.\n\nThat phase pushed me into the depths of systems thinking and engineering management. Today, as we navigate a world increasingly shaped by AI, the same core muscle matters even more: learn fast, think across disciplines, and move with clarity. My long-standing affinity for mathematics and spiritual sciences adds an unconventional edge to how I approach problems.\n\nOver the years, I've journeyed across solar, batteries, mobility, electronics, manufacturing, industrial and commercial real estate, software and beyond... all while building strong general management instincts. None of this happened by accident. It was a conscious choice to keep walking into complexity and unknowns. That's what gives me leverage today.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned, it's this: staying relevant isn't about chasing trends. It's about staying radically teachable.\n\nLet the world change.

    "category": "industry",
    "text": "🙏🏻 Why Using More Tokens Makes AI Dumber: A Mathematical Perspective \n\nMost assume that if the model were to \"think\" longer, then it would perform better. But that's not what the data bysays. Here is a way to look at it:\n\n🔍 Signal vs. Noise:\n\n• 𝑆(𝑇) = useful signal extracted after T tokens\n• 𝑁(𝑇) = noise (distractions, hallucinations, spurious patterns)\n\nThen, net accuracy = 𝑨(𝑻) = 𝑺(𝑻) − 𝑵(𝑻)\n\nAnd the kicker: 𝑑𝑁⁄𝑑𝑇 > 𝑑𝑆⁄𝑑𝑇 when 𝑇 > 𝑇𝑐\n\nAfter a certain point, every extra token adds more confusion than clarity.\n\n✅️ But the real question is\n?\n\nBecause signal is\n: there's only so much truth in a prompt. Signal lives on a low-dimensional manifold.\n\nBut noise is\n: irrelevant patterns multiply as the model searches harder. Noise lives in a high-dimensional soup.\n\n👩‍💻 Real-World Example:\n\nA model is asked, \"You have an apple and an orange. How many fruits do you have?\"\n\nWith 10 tokens: it answers 2.\n\nWith 1000 tokens: it probably starts mapping and knitting the following: Is this a metaphor? Is the orange symbolic? What does \"have\" mean? Is there a quantum aspect to this?\n\nIt ends up saying, \"1.61 fruits, depending on interpretation.\"\n\nAs humans, we also tend to occassionally face similar situations where overthinking contaminates our own evidence. You give a riddle. Some solve it in 5 seconds.\n\nOthers overthink: \"What if it's a trick?\"\n\nSame with models. Given more room to (burn tokens) compute, they simulate more worlds, not more truth. Without a strong grounding prior or external feedback, they drift.\n\nThis is the epistemic entropy problem. More computation increases the entropy of the \"belief space\", not its sharpness. Because relevant truth is\n, but the number of plausible falsehoods is\n... and the AI has no instinct to stop.\n\nP.S. The graph has a typographical error that you may not have noticed. The label should be 'Noise N(T)'. However, we can ignore it as this is a minor error. You can now congratulate me for being human! 🤷‍♂️"

Short term, we still have to work with what exists.\n\nHere is my straight talk: You don't leverage probabilistic models by trusting outputs. You leverage them by trusting processes.\n\nThese systems are idea accelerators, not answer oracles. Great at generating plausible candidates. Terrible at guarantees.\n\nSo the winning move is simple:\n\nEnforce correctness downstream. Never hope for it upstream.\n\n5 principles that actually work:\n\n1. Trust processes, not outputs\n\nYou don't review every output line by line. You design constraints that make wrong answers expensive for the model and cheap for you to catch. Ask for reasoning, not conclusions. Force assumptions into the open. Request multiple independent perspectives. Agreement across samples is not truth, but it is a useful signal. This is triangulation.\n\n2. Use AI where variance is an asset\n\nProbabilistic systems shine when you want many candidate ideas, broad coverage of a search space, or an escape from local minima in thinking. They fail when one correct answer matters, when stakes are asymmetric, or when errors compound silently. Use them for ideation, drafting, exploration, refactoring, and test generation. Never in final authority roles. Think junior analyst who never sleeps and sometimes confidently lies.\n\n3. Externalize truth\n\nThe model should never be the final source of truth. Ever. Anchor outputs to formal systems like math, code, and type checkers. Ground them in databases, APIs, and real-world signals. Insert human judgment at decision choke points. In systems language, AI operates inside a control loop, not as the loop.\n\n4. Treat probability as a dial\n\nRandomness is not a bug. It is a control surface. Sampling temperature, prompting structure, and redundancy let you tune behavior intentionally. Low variance for consistency. High variance for discovery. Multiple samples for uncertainty estimation.

She fed the model endless data about weather, time, and road patterns, hoping it would forecast exactly when traffic would snarl up. The results were a mess. The system was guessing far too much. Every day brought new variables it couldn't see coming.\n\nFrustrated, she changed her approach. Instead of trying to predict the future, she made the AI re-experience the past. She fed it years of traffic data and asked it not to predict but to reconstruct what had already happened. The model began to understand recurring causes: how sudden rain or a cricket match could ripple through the city's arteries. It wasn't fortune-telling anymore; it was pattern-recognition powered by memory.\n\nThat's when she noticed something else. The more connections the model made, the better it got. Each new data point acted like a Velcro hook, catching onto others and forming a tighter web of meaning. The AI wasn't storing isolated facts but building relationships between them. A traffic jam near the stadium linked to fan behaviour, which linked to weather forecasts, which linked to public transport usage. The richer the network, the smarter it became.\n\nHumans learn the same way. We are masters at reconstructing our past and attaching emotions, stories, and sensations to what we remember. These \"hooks\" make memories stick. We do not survive by predicting the future but by retelling the past until its lessons become instinct.\n\nAI, in its own way, mirrors that process. It learns not by seeing ahead but by looking back: replaying, connecting, and refining. Intelligence, whether human or artificial, grows from reflection, not prediction.

Short term, we still have to work with what exists.\n\nHere is my straight talk: You don't leverage probabilistic models by trusting outputs. You leverage them by trusting processes.\n\nThese systems are idea accelerators, not answer oracles. Great at generating plausible candidates. Terrible at guarantees.\n\nSo the winning move is simple:\n\nEnforce correctness downstream. Never hope for it upstream.\n\n5 principles that actually work:\n\n1. Trust processes, not outputs\n\nYou don't review every output line by line. You design constraints that make wrong answers expensive for the model and cheap for you to catch. Ask for reasoning, not conclusions. Force assumptions into the open. Request multiple independent perspectives. Agreement across samples is not truth, but it is a useful signal. This is triangulation.\n\n2. Use AI where variance is an asset\n\nProbabilistic systems shine when you want many candidate ideas, broad coverage of a search space, or an escape from local minima in thinking. They fail when one correct answer matters, when stakes are asymmetric, or when errors compound silently. Use them for ideation, drafting, exploration, refactoring, and test generation. Never in final authority roles. Think junior analyst who never sleeps and sometimes confidently lies.\n\n3. Externalize truth\n\nThe model should never be the final source of truth. Ever. Anchor outputs to formal systems like math, code, and type checkers. Ground them in databases, APIs, and real-world signals. Insert human judgment at decision choke points. In systems language, AI operates inside a control loop, not as the loop.\n\n4. Treat probability as a dial\n\nRandomness is not a bug. It is a control surface. Sampling temperature, prompting structure, and redundancy let you tune behavior intentionally. Low variance for consistency. High variance for discovery. Multiple samples for uncertainty estimation. This is operational discipline, not magic.\n\n5. Measure reliability empirically, not philosophically\n\nStop arguing about whether AI is intelligent. Start tracking where it fails. Measure error rates by task type. Identify failure modes. Watch for drift over time. Once you know where it breaks, you fence those areas off. This is how aviation, finance, and medicine work. No romance. Just guardrails.\n\nBottom line: Probabilistic models are not minds. They are leverage.\n\nLeverage doesn't need wisdom. It needs constraints, verification, and discipline.\n\nThat playbook is ancient. Still undefeated."

She fed the model endless data about weather, time, and road patterns, hoping it would forecast exactly when traffic would snarl up. The results were a mess. The system was guessing far too much. Every day brought new variables it couldn't see coming.\n\nFrustrated, she changed her approach. Instead of trying to predict the future, she made the AI re-experience the past. She fed it years of traffic data and asked it not to predict but to reconstruct what had already happened. The model began to understand recurring causes: how sudden rain or a cricket match could ripple through the city's arteries. It wasn't fortune-telling anymore; it was pattern-recognition powered by memory.\n\nThat's when she noticed something else. The more connections the model made, the better it got. Each new data point acted like a Velcro hook, catching onto others and forming a tighter web of meaning. The AI wasn't storing isolated facts but building relationships between them. A traffic jam near the stadium linked to fan behaviour, which linked to weather forecasts, which linked to public transport usage. The richer the network, the smarter it became.\n\nHumans learn the same way. We are masters at reconstructing our past and attaching emotions, stories, and sensations to what we remember. These \"hooks\" make memories stick. We do not survive by predicting the future but by retelling the past until its lessons become instinct.\n\nAI, in its own way, mirrors that process. It learns not by seeing ahead but by looking back: replaying, connecting, and refining. Intelligence, whether human or artificial, grows from reflection, not prediction.

The details of that work will remain confidential, but what matters more is something timeless: adaptability.\n\nThat phase pushed me into the depths of systems thinking and engineering management. Today, as we navigate a world increasingly shaped by AI, the same core muscle matters even more: learn fast, think across disciplines, and move with clarity. My long-standing affinity for mathematics and spiritual sciences adds an unconventional edge to how I approach problems.\n\nOver the years, I've journeyed across solar, batteries, mobility, electronics, manufacturing, industrial and commercial real estate, software and beyond... all while building strong general management instincts. None of this happened by accident. It was a conscious choice to keep walking into complexity and unknowns. That's what gives me leverage today.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned, it's this: staying relevant isn't about chasing trends. It's about staying radically teachable.\n\nLet the world change. I'll change faster."

    "text": "🙏🏻 Why Using More Tokens Makes AI Dumber: A Mathematical Perspective \n\nMost assume that if the model were to \"think\" longer, then it would perform better. But that's not what the data bysays. Here is a way to look at it:\n\n🔍 Signal vs. Noise:\n\n• 𝑆(𝑇) = useful signal extracted after T tokens\n• 𝑁(𝑇) = noise (distractions, hallucinations, spurious patterns)\n\nThen, net accuracy = 𝑨(𝑻) = 𝑺(𝑻) − 𝑵(𝑻)\n\nAnd the kicker: 𝑑𝑁⁄𝑑𝑇 > 𝑑𝑆⁄𝑑𝑇 when 𝑇 > 𝑇𝑐\n\nAfter a certain point, every extra token adds more confusion than clarity.\n\n✅️ But the real question is\n?\n\nBecause signal is\n: there's only so much truth in a prompt. Signal lives on a low-dimensional manifold.\n\nBut noise is\n: irrelevant patterns multiply as the model searches harder. Noise lives in a high-dimensional soup.\n\n👩‍💻 Real-World Example:\n\nA model is asked, \"You have an apple and an orange. How many fruits do you have?\"\n\nWith 10 tokens: it answers 2.\n\nWith 1000 tokens: it probably starts mapping and knitting the following: Is this a metaphor? Is the orange symbolic? What does \"have\" mean? Is there a quantum aspect to this?\n\nIt ends up saying, \"1.61 fruits, depending on interpretation.\"\n\nAs humans, we also tend to occassionally face similar situations where overthinking contaminates our own evidence. You give a riddle. Some solve it in 5 seconds.\n\nOthers overthink: \"What if it's a trick?\"\n\nSame with models. Given more room to (burn tokens) compute, they simulate more worlds, not more truth. Without a strong grounding prior or external feedback, they drift.\n\nThis is the epistemic entropy problem. More computation increases the entropy of the \"belief space\", not its sharpness. Because relevant truth is\n, but the number of plausible falsehoods is\n... and the AI has no instinct to stop.\n\nP.S. The graph has a typographical error that you may not have noticed. The label should be 'Noise N(T)'. However, we can ignore it as this is a minor error. You can now congratulate me for being human! 🤷‍♂️"

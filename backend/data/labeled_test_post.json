{"summary": "The text emphasizes that having infinite memory does not eliminate the possibility of reasoning errors, highlighting the distinction between memory and reasoning under uncertainty.", "category": "industry", "text": "This is one of those truths that feels obvious only after you've stared at it long enough or been sucker-punched by computer science or physics, yet people still manage to trip over it with impressive consistency.\n\nInfinite memory does not imply zero hallucination. Not even close.\n\nMemory is storage. Hallucination is reasoning failure under uncertainty. Those are orthogonal axes. You can max out one and still faceplant on the other."}

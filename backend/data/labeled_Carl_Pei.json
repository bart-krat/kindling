{"summary": "The company Nothing has successfully raised over $8M from 5,000 community investors globally, emphasizing transparency and community collaboration in its business model.", "category": "company", "text": "We just closed Community Investment (3). In less than a week we attracted 5,000 investors across 80+ countries, raising over $8M.\n\nMore than 11,000 community investors have now invested over $16M since we started Nothing.\n\nWe take this path of transparency and genuine community collaboration seriously because we believe that we can find a better and more modern way of running companies. We have a community member on the board to share full and transparent feedback every quarter, keeping us close to the ground truth as we scale. On top of that we unveiled Phone (3a) Community Edition this month, a product and campaign built by Nothing fans and for Nothing fans. We also do community fundraising so people don’t have to wait until the IPO (when shares are likely to be way more expensive) to participate in our financial journey. It takes far more effort and resources than raising from institutions, but we believe it’s integral to building a tech company for the next generation.\n\nWe raised a $200 million Series C earlier this year led by Tiger Global. Since then, we've built significant global momentum, and this recent community funding round shows how many people believe in where we're going.\n\nFor 2026, we're launching our most exciting roadmap so far, and I’m proud to have our community on the journey of what's next."}

I’m convinced one of the biggest reasons we’ve made it this far is because of support from our community. Since Phone (1) in 2022, they’ve kept us grounded, challenged us, celebrated the wins, and helped us through the setbacks.\n\nThe rise of the consumer internet means today that anyone with passion and determination can become an expert in any field. This thinking shaped our Community Board Observer, our Community Edition phones, and now extends to our Series C capital raise.\n\nWe’ve now done one of the hardest things: built a global, scaled, end-to-end capable hardware foundation. With this as a base, we’re focused on what’s next – reinventing consumer hardware in the AI era, starting with tools like Playground and Essential Apps that let anyone create software using natural language.

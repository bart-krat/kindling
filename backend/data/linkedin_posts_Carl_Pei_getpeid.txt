We just closed Community Investment (3). In less than a week we attracted 5,000 investors across 80+ countries, raising over $8M.

More than 11,000 community investors have now invested over $16M since we started Nothing.

We take this path of transparency and genuine community collaboration seriously because we believe that we can find a better and more modern way of running companies. We have a community member on the board to share full and transparent feedback every quarter, keeping us close to the ground truth as we scale. On top of that we unveiled Phone (3a) Community Edition this month, a product and campaign built by Nothing fans and for Nothing fans. We also do community fundraising so people don’t have to wait until the IPO (when shares are likely to be way more expensive) to participate in our financial journey. It takes far more effort and resources than raising from institutions, but we believe it’s integral to building a tech company for the next generation.

We raised a $200 million Series C earlier this year led by Tiger Global. Since then, we've built significant global momentum, and this recent community funding round shows how many people believe in where we're going.

For 2026, we're launching our most exciting roadmap so far, and I’m proud to have our community on the journey of what's next.

Nice surprise this morning.

Nothing Ear (3) made The Wall Street Journal’s 2025 Holiday Tech Gift Guide. 🎧

Our focus has always been on building products we genuinely enjoy using ourselves, whether that’s consumer audio or smartphones, with design treated as a first-class feature alongside the product's performance.

Huge credit to theteam for staying disciplined and obsessed with detail, and thanks to the WSJ Personal Tech team for the recognition!

Thanks Nasdaq for the shout-out! 

Today we have opened our Community Investment (3) and we’ve already surpassed the initial $5M allocation.

But it’s never been about the money. It’s about building this together - with people who challenge us, inspire us, and shape this journey with us every step of the way.

Moments like this remind us how special this journey has been. From the earliest days of the company, our community has been at the heart of everything: championing our vision, challenging us to think bigger and helping shape what we’re building 🫶🫂

Here’s to our community, the journey so far and all that’s still to come. We are just getting started, let’s go!

We are once again opening up for our community to become shareholders in Nothing!

We started Nothing to make tech fun and inspire human creativity, but what we set out to do wasn’t easy. I’m convinced one of the biggest reasons we’ve made it this far is because of support from our community. Since Phone (1) in 2022, they’ve kept us grounded, challenged us, celebrated the wins, and helped us through the setbacks.

The rise of the consumer internet means today that anyone with passion and determination can become an expert in any field. This thinking shaped our Community Board Observer, our Community Edition phones, and now extends to our Series C capital raise.

We’ve now done one of the hardest things: built a global, scaled, end-to-end capable hardware foundation. With this as a base, we’re focused on what’s next – reinventing consumer hardware in the AI era, starting with tools like Playground and Essential Apps that let anyone create software using natural language. Our community will be at the center of that future.

Excited to share that Headphone (1) has been named one of TIME’s Best Inventions 2025! 

With this product, we rethought control itself by replacing touch gestures with a new combination of buttons, roller, and paddle. Each one designed to feel precise, tactile, and intuitive. Because innovation is about rethinking how we interact, and bringing back what makes us feel connected.

Huge thanks to the entireteam for pushing the boundaries of audio and redefining how we experience audio.

Back in India this week as part of the UK’s largest trade mission, led by Keir Starmer and joined by 125 founders, CEOs, and cultural leaders. It’s been great to reconnect with the country’s fast-moving tech scene and explore new opportunities to strengthen UK–India collaboration.

India has become central to Nothing’s story — not just as a key market, but as a core part of our operations and innovation.

- We recently announced a $100M joint venture with Optiemus Infracom to expand smartphone manufacturing in India. The partnership will create 1,800+ jobs over the next three years and help scale local R&D, design, and production.

- CMF by Nothing is becoming an independent, India-headquartered brand, giving it more freedom to build for local and global audiences from the ground up.

- Our first Nothing flagship store in India later this year.

India is one of the most dynamic markets in the world — ambitious, creative, and deeply tech-savvy. Every visit is a reminder of how much innovation is happening here and how much potential there is to build together.

The fastest-growing smartphone brand in the world last quarter? 

Nothing, with 177% YoY growth in Q2. 

In a market category that's flat, this is a huge milestone and a testament to what’s possible when bold ideas meet relentless execution.

Massive credit to the team behind it. You made this happen!

Q2 2025 has been a massive moment for Nothing in India.

With 146% YoY growth, we’re once again the fastest growing smartphone brand in the country - for the 6th consecutive quarter. Nothing is the first smartphone brand ever to achieve such consistent, rapid growth.

The response from India goes far beyond the numbers. It shows up in conversations, feedback, and the growing engagement we see every day. It’s a strong signal that what we’re building truly resonates.

We’re proud of what we’ve achieved, but we’re far more excited about what comes next.

A big thank you to our team, partners, and the incredible community that’s grown with us.

India, we’re building this together. 🇮🇳

Still riding the high from yesterday’s CMF Phone 2 Pro launch in India.

During the keynote, we also shared some fresh numbers for Nothing:
📈 Fastest-growing smartphone brand in India with +156% YoY growth in Q1 2025
🖐️ 5 consecutive quarters as the fastest-growing brand
🏆 Only brand in the last 10 years to achieve this milestone in India

India is one of the most competitive tech markets anywhere, and this kind of sustained momentum doesn’t happen by accident.

Big news — Nothing just won 4 Red Dot Design Awards for 2025.

🏆 Ear (open)
🏆 Phone (2a) Plus Community Edition
🏆 Phone (3a)
🏆 Phone (3a) Pro

Every product we make is designed right here in London — with obsessive attention to detail and a clear point of view. Transparent materials, bold silhouettes, subtle lighting. Nothing is ever random.

These awards are a huge credit to our design and engineering teams who live and breathe that ethos every day. And to the Nothing community who helped shape the (2a) Plus from the inside out — you nailed it.
